          How long does it take for a tattoo to heal?
        </h5>
        <p>
          Typically, a tattoo will take around one to two weeks before it looks
          fully healed, but it will be a further few weeks before all the layers
          of skin are completely repaired. Everyone is different, and your
          healing timeline will depend on the type of ink you use, as well as
          style and size. How your tattoo heals will also depend on where it is
          on the body. Different areas have different sensitivities and skin
          types which affect the healing process. Some areas can take up to four
          months to repair completely, even though your tattoo will appear
          healed before that point.

        <h5 class="operation_header">How do I pay for my tattoo</h5>
        <p>
          To lock in your tattoo appointment, you’ll need to pay a deposit which
          will count towards the overall cost of your tattoo. You can pay your
          deposit safely and easily through the Tattoodo platform. We accept
          credit cards or online payments such as ApplePay, PayPal and Stripe.
          You can even finance your tattoo through Klarna, which is fully
          integrated with Tattoodo. Read more about Klarna here: www.klarna.com.
          Deposits are refundable up to 48 hours before your appointment.

        <h5 class="operation_header">Are tattoos safe</h5>
        <p>
          Yes, as long as you go to a reputable tattoo artist that is following
          all recommended safety precautions. Make sure you’re completely honest
          with your tattoo artist regarding any medical condition you may have
          or if prone to fainting. We always recommend getting a good night
          sleep, having a full meal and some sugar before getting a tattoo to
          alleviate dizziness, nausea, and to increase your pain tolerance.
          Getting a tattoo with a low blood sugar level is not ideal.

          Can I Bring In A Design Or Get One Custom Drawn For Me?
        </h5>
        <p>
          We encourage people to do their research. Have as much material as you
          can find to let your artist know what you are imagining. We DO NOT
          copy other people’s tattoos. If you find something on Pinterest you
          love, we can redesign it to make it unique for you or give you ideas
          on ways create a new design just right for you.
